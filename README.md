# TicTacToe Exercise 
For this task, I will be using ReactJS to bulid a tictactoe game.

## Game Rules
1. Player 1's marker is 'X' & Player 2's marker is 'O'.
2. The Two players take turns placing their marker on the board, starting with player 1
3. The plater can place their marker on any vacant spot
4. The objective of the game is for a player to get three of their markers in a row
(Horizontally, Vertically or Digaonally)

## Requirments
- [x] Ask for names of player 1 and player 2
- [x] Alernate between input for player 1 & 2
- [x] Stop when either player has won

## Usage

## Challenges
Thinking of how to make this game a N x N game.

Sudo,
1. After putting in the name, i would add an additional input
    - this additional input will allow the values 3,4,5,6 (Wont make it too big if not it will not fit the windows browser)
2. Set up value input to take this input to print out the board accordingly.
3. add additional lines to the helper.js using a swtich case
4. Each case will take in the value 3 - 6. 
5. Each case will have different patterns to look out for as the board get bigger
